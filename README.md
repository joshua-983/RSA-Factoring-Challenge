Prime Factorization (or integer factorization) is a commonly used mathematical problem often used to secure public-key encryption systems. A common practice is to use very large semi-primes (that is, the result of the multiplication of two prime numbers) as the number securing the encryption. In order to break it, they would have to find the prime factorization of the large semi-prime number – that is, two or more **prime numbers** that multiplied together result in the original number.

First off, a bit of elementary math review. What is a prime number? A prime number is any number that is only evenly divisible by 1 and itself. 2 is a prime number, as is 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and so on. There are an infinite number of prime numbers (that is numbers don’t get to a point where they are always divisible by something). Additionally, all numbers have exactly one prime factorization – that is to say, every number can be reached by multiplying some prime numbers together.
